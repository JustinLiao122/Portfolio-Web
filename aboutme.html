            <div class="aboutme__body--aboutme">
                <p>My name is Justin Liao, and I was born on May 3, 2003, in Toronto, Canada. At around the age of seven, I moved to Texas, marking the beginning of a new chapter in my life. This transition led me to attend Seven Lakes High School, where I embarked on both my academic and athletic journeys. </p>
                
                <p>Currently, I am a student at Boston University, where I continue to pursue my academic goals. Beyond my studies, I am also a dedicated Division 1 athlete, specializing in swimming. My passion for swimming has been a significant part of my life for over 12 years, and it remains a pursuit I am deeply committed to. </p>

                <p>I pride myself on being a fast learner with a strong focus on self-improvement. This drive for improvement is not just limited to my athletic endeavors but permeates all aspects of my life, including my academic pursuits. My journey from Toronto to Texas and now Boston reflects my adaptability and dedication to growth, both personally and professionally.</p>
                <p>Outside my academic and athletic commitments, my passions extend to helping others and solving problems, which bring me immense satisfaction. My interests include drawing, for its creative outlet, and skiing, which offers a thrilling contrast to swimming's discipline. These hobbies, alongside my volunteer work, underscore my eagerness to support and uplift those around me.</p>
                <p>I'm driven by the goal to apply my skills and experiences toward making a significant impact. Whether itâ€™s through direct assistance or leveraging my abilities, I aim to contribute meaningfully wherever possible, always seeking new experiences to enhance my capacity to help others.</p>
